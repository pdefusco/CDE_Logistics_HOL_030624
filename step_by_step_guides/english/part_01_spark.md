### A Brief Introduction to Spark

Apache Spark is an open-source, distributed processing system used for big data workloads. It has gained extreme popularity as the go-to engine for interactive Data Analysis and the deployment of Production Data Engineering and Machine Learning pipelines at scale.

In CDE you can use Spark to explore data interactively via CDE Sessions or deploy batch data engineering pipelines via CDE Jobs.

### Lab 1: Run PySpark Interactive Session

Navigate to the CDE Home Page and launch a PySpark Session. Leave default settings intact.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesession-1.png)

Once the Session is ready, open the "Interact" tab in order to enter your code.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesession-2.png)

You can copy and paste code from the instructions into the notebook by clicking on the icon at the top right of the code cell.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesession-3.png)

Copy the following cell into the notebook. Before running it, ensure that you have edited the "username" variable with your assigned user.

```
from os.path import exists
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
import pyspark.sql.functions as F
from pyspark.sql.types import *

storageLocation = "s3a://cde-innovation-buk-9e384927/data"
username = "user002"
```

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesession-4.png)

No more code edits are required. Continue running each code snippet below in separate cells in the notebook.

```
### LOAD HISTORICAL TRANSACTIONS FILE FROM CLOUD STORAGE
transactionsDf = spark.read.json("{0}/mkthol/trans/{1}/transactions".format(storageLocation, username))
transactionsDf.printSchema()
```

```
### CREATE PYTHON FUNCTION TO FLATTEN PYSPARK DATAFRAME NESTED STRUCTS
def flatten_struct(schema, prefix=""):
    result = []
    for elem in schema:
        if isinstance(elem.dataType, StructType):
            result += flatten_struct(elem.dataType, prefix + elem.name + ".")
        else:
            result.append(F.col(prefix + elem.name).alias(prefix + elem.name))
    return result
```

```
### RUN PYTHON FUNCTION TO FLATTEN NESTED STRUCTS AND VALIDATE NEW SCHEMA

### Lab 2: Create CDE Resources and Run CDE Spark Job

Up until now you used Sessions to interactively explore data. CDE also allows you to run Spark Application code in batch with as a CDE Job. There are two types of CDE Jobs: Spark and Airflow. In this lab we will create a CDE Spark Job and revisit Airflow later in part 3.

The CDE Spark Job is an abstraction over the Spark Submit. With the CDE Spark Job you can create a reusable, modular Spark Submit definition that is saved in CDE and can be modified in the CDE UI (or via the CDE CLI and API) before every run according to your needs. CDE stores the job definition for each run in the Job Runs UI so you can go back and refer to it long after your job has completed.

Furthermore, CDE allows you to directly store artifacts such as Python files, Jars and other dependencies, or create Python environments and Docker containers in CDE as "CDE Resources". Once created in CDE, Resources are available to CDE Jobs as modular components of the CDE Job definition which can be swapped and referenced by a particular job run as needed.

These features dramatically reduce the amount of work and effort normally required to manage and monitor Spark Jobs in a Spark Cluster. By providing a unified view over all your runs along with the associated artifacts and dependencies, CDE streamlines CI/CD pipelines and removes the need for glue code in your Spark cluster.

In the next steps we will see these benefits in actions.

##### Create CDE Python Resource

Navigate to the Resources tab and create a Python Resource. Make sure to select the Virtual Cluster assigned to you if you are creating a Resource from the CDE Home Page, and to name the Python Resource after your username e.g. "fraud-prevention-py-user100" if you are "user100".

Upload the "requirements.txt" file located in the "cde_spark_jobs" folder. This can take up to a few minutes.

Please familiarize yourself with the contents of the "requirements.txt" file and notice that it contains a few Python libraries such as Pandas and PyArrow.

Then, move on to the next section even while the environment build is still in progress.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdepythonresource-2.png)

##### Create CDE Files Resource

From the Resources page create a CDE Files Resource. Upload all files contained in the "cde_spark_jobs" folder. Again, ensure the Resource is named after your unique workshop username and it is created in the Virtual Cluster assigned to you.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdefilesresource-1.png)

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdefilesresource-2.png)

Before moving on to the next step, please familiarize yourself with the code in the "01_fraud_report.py", "utils.py", and "parameters.conf" files.

Notice that "01_fraud_report.py" contains the same PySpark Application code you ran in the CDE Session, with the exception that the column casting and renaming steps have been refactored into Python functions in the "utils.py" script.

Finally, notice the contents of "parameters.conf". Storing variables in a file in a Files Resource is one method used by CDE Data Engineers to dynamically parameterize scripts with external values.

##### Create CDE Spark Job

Now that the CDE Resources have been created you are ready to create your first CDE Spark Job.

Navigate to the CDE Jobs tab and click on "Create Job". The long form loaded to the page allows you to build a Spark Submit as a CDE Spark Job, step by step.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesparkjob-1.png)

Enter the following values without quotes into the corresponding fields. Make sure to update the username with your assigned user wherever needed:

* Job Type: Spark
* Name: 01_fraud_report_userxxx
* File: Select from Resource -> "01_fraud_report.py"
* Arguments: userxxx
* Configurations:
  - key: spark.sql.autoBroadcastJoinThreshold
  - value: 11M

The form should now look similar to this:

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesparkjob-2.png)

Finally, open the "Advanced Options" section.

Notice that your CDE Files Resource has already been mapped to the CDE Job for you.

Then, update the Compute Options by increasing "Executor Cores" and "Executor Memory" from 1 to 2.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesparkjob-3.png)

Finally, run the CDE Job by clicking the "Create and Run" icon.

##### CDE Job Run Observability

Navigate to the Job Runs page in your Virtual Cluster and notice a new Job Run is being logged automatically for you.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesparkjob-4.png)

Once the run completes, open the run details by clicking on the Run ID integer in the Job Runs page.

![alt text](../../img/part1-cdesparkjob-5.png)

Open the logs tab and validate output from the Job Run in the Driver -> Stdout tab.

### Summary

In this section you first explored two datasets interactively with CDE Interactive sessions. This feature allowed you to run ad-hoc queries on large, structured and unstructured data, and prototype Spark Application code for batch execution.

Then, you created a batch Spark Job to turned your application prototype into scheduled execution.

In the process, you improved your code for reusability by modularizing your logic into functions, and stored those functions as a utils script in a CDE Files Resource. You also leveraged your Files Resource by storing dynamic variables in a parameters configurations file and applying a runtime variable via the Arguments field. In the context of more advanced Spark CI/CD pipelines both the parameters file and the Arguments field can be overwritten and overridden at runtime.

In order to improve performance you translated the PySpark UDF into a Pandas UDF. You created a CDE Python Resource and attached it to the CDE Job Definition in order to use Pandas and other Python libraries in your PySpark job.

Finally, you ran the job and observed outputs in the CDE Job Runs page. CDE stored Job Runs, logs, and associated CDE Resources for each run. This provided you real time job monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities, along with post-execution storage of logs, run dependencies, and cluster information.
